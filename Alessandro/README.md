These codes are extensions of the GMCA code for the BINGO project.

There are two main jupyter-notebook

1) NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_buildingCls: It do wavelet transform (starlet), component separation from GMCA for all set of maps and build cls output 

2) NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_analisys: It do noise debias using the outputs from NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_buildingCls.
