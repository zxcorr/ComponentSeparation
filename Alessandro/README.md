These codes are extensions of the GMCA code for the BINGO project.

Put these codes in the same directory as the "scripts" in the GMCA directory

There are two main jupyter-notebook

1) NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_buildingCls: It does wavelet transform (starlet), component separation from GMCA for entire set of maps and creates cls output 

2) NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_analisys: It does noise debias using the outputs from NoiseDebiasing2GMCA_buildingCls.
