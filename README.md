# ComponentSeparation

This repository was created with the aim of maintaining all the wavelet transformation codes and component separation methods created or adapted by group and that we are using.
 
It's a public code, but if you will use it I would like you to quote us:
 - Generalised Morphological Component Analysis applied to HI signals from Intensity Mapping - A. Marins et al (in preparation)
 - Different Component Separation Methods for BINGO Telescope - A. Marins et al (in preparation)
 
It was created by 
 - Alessandro Marins (USP)
 - Julia Leite (USP)
 - Luiz Henrique de Freitas Assis (USP)
 - Karin Fornazier (USP and INPE)
 - Filipe Abdalla (UCL, USP, INPE and RU)

USP  = Universidade de Sao Paulo (Brazil)
INPE = Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Brazil)
UCL  = University College London (UK)
RU   = Rhodes University (South Africa)
